# Portfolio Optimization
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and implementation of portfolio optimization techniques such as Monte Carlo Simulation and Markowitz's mean-variance optimization to calculate the mean returns, volatility and Sharpe Ratio.

### Portfolio Metrics:
Return and Volatility Calculation: Computing the returns and volatility of various assets in the portfolio.
Efficient Frontier: Constructing the efficient frontier to visualize the trade-off between risk and return.

### Optimization Techniques:
Mean-Variance Optimization: Applying Markowitz's mean-variance optimization / Monte Carlo Simulation to find the optimal portfolio.
Sharpe Ratio Maximization: Identifying the portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.
