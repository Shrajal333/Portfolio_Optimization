Portfolio Optimization
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and implementation of portfolio optimization techniques using various financial metrics and models. The notebook covers the following key aspects:

Key Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loading financial data and preprocessing it for analysis.
Return and Volatility Calculation: Computing the returns and volatility of various assets in the portfolio.
Efficient Frontier: Constructing the efficient frontier to visualize the trade-off between risk and return.
Optimization Techniques:
Mean-Variance Optimization: Applying Markowitz's mean-variance optimization to find the optimal portfolio.
Sharpe Ratio Maximization: Identifying the portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.
Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP): Using HRP to create diversified portfolios that account for hierarchical clustering of assets.
Visualization
Risk-Return Scatter Plot: A scatter plot to visualize the risk-return profiles of various portfolios.
Efficient Frontier Plot: Visualization of the efficient frontier with the optimal portfolios highlighted.
Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap to display the correlation matrix of the assets.
